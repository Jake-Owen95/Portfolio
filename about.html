                    <h1>HI, I'M JAKE</h1>

                    <p>I studied at Hyperion Dev and completed a 6 month course in software engineering. 
                        
                        For the past 4 months I have worked as an intern for a startup called Sapphire Gem Tech who specialize in creating web applications.
                        I spend lots of my time learning. Using that knowladge I have built features for the companies portfolio websites.
                        The company works mostly in Ruby on Rails so this is the web-appliaction framework I have been working in most. 
                        
                        As a software engineer I think my skill set is more on the back end. 
                        But I have come to find I really enjoy working on the front end and learning about design priniciples. 
                        I love the problem solving nature of programming and find the rewards of solving a problem incredibly satisfying. 

                        My most recent project has been the not-uberEats restuarant directory that I have brought to South Africa. This website lists 
                        all restaurants in cape town with independent delivery, saving restuarants and users money with the exlcusion of extra fees. 
                        I will be adding more areas to the website as it grows in popularity.
